## Project Status
The project is a work in progress. I need to add the ability to edit products in the shopping cart, payment method, shipping method when placing an order and many other features to simplify ordering.

## Sources
The application was created during the course Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2022 Edition] by Maximilian Schwarzmüller from Academind. On my own, I change the method of adding a picture. Storage in Firebase instead of writing the URL address of a photo.
